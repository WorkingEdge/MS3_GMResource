  <h1 class="jumbo-header-neutral">What are green manures?</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Green manures are plant species grown before, after, or between cash crops
    for the benefits they bring in relation to soil fertility, pest and weed
    suppression, biodiverstiy, and soil health. They can be an important part of
    land management for horticultural enterprises and farms, particularly in an
    organic context. Green manures can be grown as a single species or as a
    multi-species mix.
  </p>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <p class="jumbotron-para-reg">
    There are many different species and species mixes that are considered green
    manures or cover crops and each one has a particular application and is
    suited for different conditions. Some green manures, like clover, fix
    nitrogen from the air and reduce the need for the application of synthetic
    fertilizer. Others may be beneficial for pollinating insects or for soil
    conditioning.
